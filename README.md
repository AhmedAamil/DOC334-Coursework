# DOC334 - Introduction to Programming P2 Coursework

You are to create a console Python 3.x program which will allow users to demonstrate a small program
for a library.

**Scenario**

Currently all books available at ABC books store are managed using a manual process. Users should search
for books from the racks which is a time taking process. With the increase of software development in
every field developing book management software will be helpful task. It is needed to develop a system
which is useful for maintain books in a procedure-oriented manner. Users should be able to easily search
for books from index page and search for books to find their required book.

Design and develop fully transactional console-based application which has the following functionalities.

1. Books: Facility to create information related each book in the bookstore. Input: Book No (Primary Key), Title, Subject Code, Author, Publisher, Price, Location, AND any other information you think it is useful to have.

2. Books Chapters: Facility to create books chapter information. For every book available on the site has to have a clear view to read each chapter using books chapters view. Input: Book No, Chapter No, Title, starting page no, Ending page no

3. Subjects: Facility to create subjects. Books available on the site should sub divided into different category which will help users to easily find required category books. Input: Subject Code, Name

4. Books Query: Direct search is needed to find books available on the site. Users must be able to search by book number, Book Title, Author OR Publisher.

5. Add/Edit/Delete Books: Facility should be provided add, edit, or delete information related to a book.

**Your Task**

You are to create a Python 3.x program which mimics the above requirements. Your program must run in
the console. GUI base program will result ZERO marks. You can decide how the program menu and the console interface will look like, based on the above requirements. You must clearly state your assumptions if you have any.

**Tasks to Complete**

1. You must use proper Python 3.x program constructs such as packages, modules, functions, variables, data structures, etc. to develop this program.

2. The user must be able to do requested tasks

3. Records must be stored by using a database

4. If a DB is used, username must be “root” with no passwords and the server must be “localhost”

5. You should also provide means to import/restore your current database for marking purposes. Failing to do this will result lower marks or no marks for that component.

6. If a text file is used, the extension must be of .TXT

7. You can use external packages which will help you to develop the program.

8. You are to develop a console-based application with a suitable menu system to complete this
task.
